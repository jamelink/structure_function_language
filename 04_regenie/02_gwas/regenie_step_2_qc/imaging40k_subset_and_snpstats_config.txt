## CONFIGURATION FOR SUBSETTING AND SNP STATISTICS CALCULATION ##



## INPUT

RunName=FLICA_st2_GWAS
# Name for the run/subset (will be used to name the output files)

ImagingSubsetData=/data/clusterfs/lag/users/jitame/SENT_CORE/geno/regenie/step_2_sent_all/gwas/st2_in/imagingT1

# Path to the full imaging subset data that is used as a starting point for filtering
# Enter only the prefix of the file (filename without chromosome number, .bgen, .sample, etc.)
# There are four possible prefixes for the existing subsets:
# Version 1, White British ancestry: imaging40k or imaging_40k_no_rel_filter
# Version 2, White ancestry: imaging40k_wa or imaging40k_wa_no_rel_filter, 
# It is recommended to copy the data from the workspace to the clusterfs before subsetting.

SubjectList=/data/clusterfs/lag/users/jitame/SENT_CORE/exome_subs_plink.txt
# A custom list of subjects to be included in the subset



## OUTPUT

OutDir=/data/clusterfs/lag/users/jitame/SENT_CORE/geno/regenie/gwas/st2_in/filtered
# Working directory where (intermediate) output files are written to
